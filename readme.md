# Gravity platform - Unique platformer game
Gravity Platform (also know as Gravity.exe) is a platformer game where platform oriantation changes perspective
and gravity. I worked on this project in 2016-2017.

The ripple effect is done with custom GLSL shaders and can be found in `android/assets/ripple.frag`
